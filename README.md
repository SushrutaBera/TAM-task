# TAM Task Project
This a task given by The AI and ML(TAM) club.
## Overview

This project involves data analysis and visualization using Python libraries such as:
- `numpy`
- `pandas`
- `seaborn`
- `scikit-learn`
- `matplotlib`

The main tasks include removal of missing values, detecting and removing outliers, extracting time-based features, and creating various plots.

## Features

- **Handling Missing Values**: Identifies the missing values (marked by a value of -200) and applies an appropriate imputation technique to handle them.
- **Outlier Detection and Removal**: Detect outliers using Z-score or IQR methods based on skewness and remove them from the dataset.
- **Time-Based Feature Extraction**: Extract features such as hour of the day, day of the week, and month of the year from a datetime column.
- **Data Visualization**: Create various plots including scatter plots, density plots, and 3D scatter plots.

## Usage

To use the application, open `main.ipynb` and run it.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/tam-task.git
